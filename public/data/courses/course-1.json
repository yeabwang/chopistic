John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Herbert Simon, and others believed computers could simulate human intelligence.\nEarly programs amazed the world â€“ one could solve algebra problems, another could play checkers.\nPause & Think: Why do you think people in the 1950s were so fascinated with this idea?"

From HAL 9000 in *2001: A Space Odyssey* to R2-D2 in *Star Wars*, fiction shaped our fears and hopes.\nThese cultural images influenced how the public and even researchers thought about AI.\nMini Summary: Pop culture often makes AI look magical, but in reality, todayâ€™s AI is much narrower."
